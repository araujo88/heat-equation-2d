# heat-equation-2d

Python two-dimensional transient heat equation solver using finite difference scheme. The code is restricted to cartesian rectangular meshes but can be adapted to curvilinear coordinates. Case parameters are already set-up for a thin steel plate of dimensions 10 cm x 10 cm. Boundary conditions are of fixed temperature (Dirichlet-type) but can be modified for Neumann-type (fixed flux). Any suggestions are welcomed and appreciated.
